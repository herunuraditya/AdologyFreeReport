NASA just got EXPOSED hiding crystal-clear color + thermal shots of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS.

They dropped a TERRIBLE blurry gray potato photo, like we was stupid...

The actual files they published prove they got PERFECT high-res multi-spectral data… then deliberately buried it.

ALL EVIDENCE IS IN THE METADATA! 

Why the cover-up...?
